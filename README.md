# Rust Data Engineering

Website for projects here: [https://nogibjj.github.io/rust-data-engineering/](https://nogibjj.github.io/rust-data-engineering/)

A few projects for Rust Data Engineering Coursera course that I've kept to use as an intro to Rust:
1) csv-demo
2) data-eng-rust-tutorial
3) polars-hello-world-code-whisperer

Adding a few projects from what I've learned:
1) rust_yahoo_finance | `cd rust_yahoo_finance` and check out the [README](https://github.com/nogibjj/rust_mini_project8_JCB/blob/main/rust_yahoo_finance/README.md) for implementation
2) python_yahoo_finance | replicated the same project i did in Rust so I could compare performance `cd python_yahoo_finance`

# Rust vs Python performance metrics
'report results using 1 ticker'
'report results using 4 tickers'

### future learning:
1) rust vs python **check
2) rust in the cloud
